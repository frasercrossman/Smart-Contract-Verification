# Smart-Contract-Verification
Repository of lab work completed as part of my dissertation on smart contract 
verification.

## Lab 1 - "Testing the Waters"
Explored the possibilities of the approach.

## Lab 2 - "Refining the Method"
Continued to convert more Solidity smart contracts to C for verification.

## Lab 3 - "Detecting Reentrancy"
Continued to convert smart contracts to C and used `cbmc` for
verification, focusing on smart contracts vulnerable to reentrancy attacks.
